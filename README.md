# Automated-Music-Tagging-for-EDM-Track-Filtering

This project is a Streamlit-based application for automated genre tagging of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) tracks. It is built on top of the [MAEST](https://github.com/palonsom/MAEST) model and uses the [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/) library for audio feature extraction.

Its main purpose is to help producers and curators automatically classify EDM tracks into different genres, enabling faster filtering in demo/promo submission drops.
